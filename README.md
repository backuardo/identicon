# :space_invader: Identicon

"Our Identicons are simple 5x5 “pixel” sprites that are generated using a hash of the user’s ID. The algorithm walks through the hash and turns pixels on or off depending on even or odd values. These generated patterns, combined with hash-determined color values, ensures a huge number of unique Identicons."
